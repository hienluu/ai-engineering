#### Terminology
* Workflows: systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths
* Agent: refers to an entity that can act on behalf of another
* Agents: systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks
* Agency: the ability to make decisions, undertake tasks, and act for someone or something
* Agents have agency. They dynamically decide which tools to use and how many steps to take. The number of steps isn't predetermined, each outcome shapes what comes next.
